This was a university project aimed at parsing text data from an XML file containing >50k job listings, cleaning it including through use of regex (task 1 & 2) and integrating it with a second CSV which had a different schema (task 3). See task1_2.ipynb (which has been zipped as it is 49Mb) and task3.ipynb for further details.
