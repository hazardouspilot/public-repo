This was a group uni assignment which I chose to complete individually. 
Groups selected their own dataset for the project with the main 
restriction being that it could not be time series data. 
It is the main project for Machine Learning, in which I clean and 
vizualise a churn dataset (phase 1) and carry out feature selection, 
tune 4 ML models using the data and evaluate the models (phase 2).
