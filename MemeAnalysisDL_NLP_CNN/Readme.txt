This was an individual assignment for Deep Learning in my final semester. 

The task was to develop a deep learning model using transfer learning to 
identify the persuasive techniques used in each meme and the location of 
the text associated with each persuasive technique within the meme's text. 
This involved combining pretrained CNN and NLP models.
