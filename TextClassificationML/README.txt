This is an individual RMIT assignment using text processing and pretrained vector 
embeddings to classify job ads. The final stage of the project involved developing 
a Flask app which facilitates searching and creation of job listings, leveraging 
the models devloped in the previous stage. 

The necessary outputs from the first stage (tasks 1-3) have been included in the 
flaskApp folder so that the flaskApp can run independently. The flaskApp folder 
has its own README file. Outputs from task2_3 have been removed to reduce file size.
