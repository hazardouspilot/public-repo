This is a logbook app for logging climbs in climbing gyms. 
It is mostly a project for the sake of my learning. 

In its current state the app has an SQL database running on 
Azure and front end running on an AWS ec2 using Flask. 
The web app is live at ec2-52-205-224-62.compute-1.amazonaws.com, 
however it has not been thoroughly tested, and is only running 
on free and student teir services.
